# WAUU LMS - West African Union University Learning Management System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) built with Flask for West African Union University in Cotonou, Benin. The system facilitates online education through course management, assignment submission, grading, and discussion forums. It supports role-based access control with three user types: students, instructors, and administrators.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap 5 framework
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5 with custom WAUU wine color theme (#722f37)
- **Icons**: Font Awesome for consistent iconography
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript for interactive features (tooltips, form validation, file upload preview)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Bootstrap grid system

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework) with modular structure
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy with Flask-SQLAlchemy integration
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login for session management and user authentication
- **Security**: Password hashing with Werkzeug, secure file uploads
- **File Handling**: Werkzeug utilities for secure filename handling and file uploads

### Database Architecture
- **Primary Database**: SQLite (default) with PostgreSQL support via environment variable
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with declarative base model
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling with automatic reconnection (pool_recycle: 300s)
- **Schema**: Comprehensive relational model with proper foreign key relationships

## Key Components

### User Management System
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Three distinct roles (student, instructor, admin) with appropriate permissions
- **Authentication**: Username/password based login with secure password hashing
- **User Profiles**: Complete user information management with profile editing capabilities
- **Access Control Decorators**: `@admin_required` and `@instructor_required` for route protection

### Course Management
- **Course Creation**: Instructors can create courses with unique course codes
- **Course Enrollment**: Students can enroll in available courses
- **Course Materials**: File upload system for course resources and materials
- **Instructor Assignment**: Courses are assigned to specific instructors

### Assignment System
- **Multiple Submission Types**: Support for text submissions, file uploads, and URL submissions
- **Due Date Management**: Optional due dates with overdue detection
- **Point-Based Grading**: Configurable maximum points per assignment
- **Submission Tracking**: Complete history of student submissions with timestamps

### Grading System
- **Assignment Grading**: Instructor interface for grading with feedback
- **Grade Calculation**: Automatic percentage calculations based on points earned

- **Post Management**: Students and instructors can create posts and replies
- **Discussion Moderation**: Instructor oversight of discussion content

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in through Flask-Login, creating secure sessions
2. **Role-Based Routing**: Decorators check user permissions before allowing access to protected routes
3. **Course Enrollment**: Students enroll in courses, creating enrollment records
4. **Assignment Workflow**: Instructors create assignments → Students submit → Instructors grade → Grades recorded
5. **File Management**: Secure file uploads to designated upload directory with filename validation
6. **Discussion Flow**: Users create discussions/posts → Database storage → Real-time display
